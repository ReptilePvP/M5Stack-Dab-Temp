# M5Stack Dab Temp

Full project documentation for the "M5Stack Dab Temp" example project.

---

## Summary

This repository contains a PlatformIO project targeting M5Stack hardware. The project appears to be an example or demo named "Hub Example" in the local workspace and includes code and supporting files under `src/`, `include/`, `lib/` and `test/`.

Primary goals:
- Provide firmware for an M5Stack unit with temperature-related functionality (inferred from the name).
- Offer an example project structure that can be used as a starting point for development and testing on M5Stack hardware.

## Current state (as of 2025-12-11)

- Repository name: `M5Stack Dab Temp`
- State: Initial import of the local project files. No CI is configured. No release assets.
- Branches: single `main` branch created.
- Known files included in this import:
  - `platformio.ini` (project configuration)
  - `src/` (source files; primary entry `src/main.cpp`)
  - `include/`, `lib/` (local libraries and headers)
  - `.gitignore`, `README.md` (this file)

Short notes about next steps and recommended improvements:
- Add a detailed Hardware Requirements section to explain which M5Stack unit and peripherals are required.
- Add a CONTRIBUTING.md if you expect outside contributors.
- Add CI (PlatformIO CI or GitHub Actions) to build and validate commits.
- Add tests for critical components where possible, and include instructions to run them locally.
- Add an explicit LICENSE (MIT recommended if you want permissive reuse).

## How this import was performed

The local project directory was initialized as a git repository and an initial commit created. A public GitHub repository named `M5Stack-Dab-Temp` was created and the local files were uploaded as the initial commit.

If anything looks off (missing files, incorrect repository name, or you want a different license/visibility), tell me and I will update the repo accordingly.

## Contact / Maintainer

Maintainer: GitHub user that created the repo (automation via MCP server). If you'd like to set a different owner/org, tell me and I will recreate or transfer the repository as needed.
